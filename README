to be able to build in shippable, you should
- send us your github username
- create an ssh key integration in shippable, and send us its public key
- create a key-value integration which exports your sonar token as 'sonarkey'
- create a key-value integration (can be the same) which exports your github api token with repo scope as 'issuetoken'
